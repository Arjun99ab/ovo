## Common Questions

**How do I access the mod menu?**
In the main menu and pause menu, an icon like this, ⁝≣ , will appear on the left side. Click that to access the mod menu.

On any page of the of the menu, the bottom will have a bright green "Add Mod" button. Here you can specify the name, code, and description of the mod. 
*The name and code are required to successfully add the mod.*

How do I delete a mod that I added?**
Navigate to the page of the custom mod, and on the bottom you will see buttons to both edit the mod, and delete. 

**Why do some mods reload the page when I disable them?**
Currently, the chaos mod and any custom created mod will reload on disabling. This is due to the way script are loaded in Javascript.
